<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s the kind of thing all these sorts of 
notices say, but frankly we mean it. You’ve placed your trust in us by using the Booking.com services and we
 value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. 
 We act in our customers’ interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>This document describes how we use and process your personal data, hopefully provided in a readable and 
transparent manner so you can get where we’re coming from without getting bored senseless. As an added bonus,
 it also tells you how to contact us if you have questions about your personal data, which we’re more than happy 
 to answer. Please also read our separate Cookie Statement, which tells you how Booking.com makes use of cookies
  and other similar technologies. For a better understanding of what we mean by “Trip”, “Trip Provider”, 
  “Trip Service” and “Trip Reservation”, please read the Booking.com Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used us before, you’ll know that Booking.com offers online travel-related services through our
 own websites and mobile apps, as well as through other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social
  media. Why point that out, you ask? Well, here’s the thing. All the information that follows applies to not one,
   not two, but all of these platforms. Several platforms, one privacy statement.</p>
<p>This one privacy statement applies to any kind of information we collect through these platforms or other means
 connected to these platforms (such as contacting our customer service team via email). It makes for a lot less
  tedious reading. If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our Privacy Statement for
   Business Partners to understand how personal data is further processed as part of the business relationship.</p>
<p>We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time. If you care about your privacy, visit this page regularly
 and you’ll know exactly where you stand. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement which will have an impact
  on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes than communicated in the 
  past in this Privacy Statement), we will notify you of these changes before the new activities begin.</p>
<p>Sad but necessary bit: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue using our services.
 If you agree with our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to book your next Trip through us. Let the good 
 times roll!</p>
